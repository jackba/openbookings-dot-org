15/03/2006 - 0.7.0 beta
 - Little code cleanup, mainly to improve css stylesheet implementation (which is still not perfect, I acknowledge)
 - Added simple layout customisation settings (whole app background color, path to logo image file, welcome message)
 - Added custom date format setting
 - Added a "My bookings" page for users to list/remember their own bookings
 - Added user account locking, the checkbox was present in the user profile page but the function wasn't really implemented until now
 - Added a "Guest" user profile. Users with guest profile can browse bookings without doing changes. You can now create several named guests accounts and/or create a guest account with public credentials to allow anonymous browsing.(thanks Martin) 
 - Replaced the "Activity step" select list by a simple text field to allow large booking steps for daily booking (hotel rooms, car rent...)
 - Bug fix #8 : At login attempt failure, the login/password error message wasn't displayed under the login box
 - Bug fix #9 : Few bookings wouldn't show on the main calendar due to "$year" and "$year_" variables confusion in calendar.php
 - Bug fix #10 : In day.php and week.php, graphics were drawn too large on computers using dual-screen mode. Drawing with is now fixed to 800 pixels.
 - Changed the program behavior to avoid opening popups, witch might be confusing when accidentaly hidden behind the main navigator window, and mignt also be blocked according to the navigator security settings.
 - Renamed $app_path var to $app_url in the config.php (less confusing)
